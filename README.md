This research delves into the intricate task of predicting income classes through the lens of demographic and employment-related features. Leveraging classification techniques, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes, we aim to accurately classify individuals into two income categories: those earning less than or equal to $50,000 and those earning more. We meticulously preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we analyze the performance of each algorithm, considering metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC analysis. Additionally, we provide a comparative analysis with existing techniques, highlighting the strengths and limitations of our proposed method. Our findings contribute to the discourse on income prediction and demographic analysis, offering insights into model interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, with implications for informed decision-making in policy and social sciences research.
